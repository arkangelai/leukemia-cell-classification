# Leukemia Detection Algorithm
This repository contains a model trained and API developed to detect Leukemia in children

Training for this model was done using Arkangel AI's development tool 'Hippocrates' which trains different architectures and configurations to get the best possible performance out of a convolutional neural network for a given problem.

This repository contains the best model so far in format .h5, this model was validated under a hold out scheme by joining training and validation cohorts from the dataset and splitting this merged set into train, test and validation samples respectively. As a result, performance metrics for the test cohort are:

* Accuracy: 0.94
* Area Under the ROC Curve: 0.98
* Sensitivity: 0.95
* Specificity: 0.93
* F1-macro: 0.93

### New features:

* Improved the precision metrics of the algorithm
* Supports automatic segmentation of lymphocytes from a raw data
* Build an API that handles the whole detection pipeline


### Contributing
The main purpose of this repository is to continue evolving the Leukemia core, making it faster and easier to use. Development of the model happens in the open on GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements. Read below to learn how you can take part in improving the solution.
