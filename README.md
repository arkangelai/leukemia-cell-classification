# Leukemia Detection Algorithm
This repository contains a model trained and API developed to detect Leukemia in children

Training for this model was done using Arkangel AI's development tool 'Hippocrates' which trains different architectures and configurations to get the best possible performance out of a convolutional neural network for a given problem.

This repository contains the best model so far in format .h5, this model was validated under a hold out scheme by joining training and validation cohorts from the dataset and splitting this merged set into train, test and validation samples respectively. As a result, performance metrics for the test cohort are:

* Accuracy: 0.94
* Area Under the ROC Curve: 0.98
* Sensitivity: 0.95
* Specificity: 0.93
* F1-macro: 0.93

### TO RUN IT:

* Access this collab: https://colab.research.google.com/github/arkangelai/leukemia-cell-classification/blob/main/Leukemia-classification-api-test_colab.ipynb
* Choose one of our sample image or upload yours.
* Get a prediction.

### New features:

* Improved the precision metrics of the algorithm
* Supports automatic segmentation of lymphocytes from a raw data
* Build an API that handles the whole detection pipeline

### Prediction pipeline:
The following process is performed to detect and predict lymphocites in thin blood smears:
* A tiling algorithm using a 3x3 grid with repetition with an offset, this results in 9 tiles per image without offset and other 9 tiles by translating the grid.
* Screening each tile by using a classifier i.e predicting whether each tile is going to be fed to our object detection model or if it is discarded as it is not likely to contain any relevant WBC structure.
* Detection of WBC structures by using our trained YoloV3 algorithm.
* Classification of each detected bounding-box with a second classifier that distinguishes between lymphocites and leukoblasts.

the following images illustrate the process:

YOLO detection for generated tiles at the first step of the proposed pipeline. Ground truth boxes are presented in black whereas detected boxes are displayed in green.

Grid offset benefit illustration: In this example detections are presented in red and cyan, where the red bounding boxes correspond to the original grid whereas the ones in cyan correspond to the grid with an offset.

This example illustrates a given detection with classification. Color codes are as follows: green corresponds to ground truth, yellow to WBC and red to Leukoblast
